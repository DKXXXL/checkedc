  % Programs written in C account for a significant portion of code
  % currently in use, despite its lack of memory safety which has been
  % the cause of many disastrous vulnerabilities throughout the years.
  % %
  % Checked C is a Microsoft-backed attempt at a solution to this problem
  % which extends C with types and annotations that guarantees spatial
  % memory safety in a backwards compatible manner, while allowing
  % the mix of checked and unchecked code.
  % %
  % However, Checked C's implementation is a complex beast built on top
  % of Clang, while Checked C's specification is over \leo{X} pages of
  % natural language, reducing confidence in the promised guarantees.

  \systemname is an improvement of the \checkedc compiler with the formalism of RLBox.
